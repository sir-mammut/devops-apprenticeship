# 30-Day DevOps Apprenticeship 🚀

## 👋 About Me

I’m **Hamisu Muhammad**, a Senior Software Engineer (Full-Stack) with 7+ years of experience building scalable applications.
Now, I’m leveling up by undertaking a **30-day DevOps apprenticeship** — a hands-on, real-world style journey to master modern DevOps practices.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Apprenticeship

DevOps is the backbone of modern engineering teams — it’s about automation, reliability, collaboration, and delivering value faster.
This project is my **public learning log**, designed to:

- Showcase my ability to learn and implement DevOps practices.
- Build a portfolio recruiters and hiring managers can review.
- Transition my skill set into a strong **DevOps + Cloud Engineering profile**.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools I’ll Cover

Over 30 days, I’ll work through practical, production-ready DevOps workflows:

- **Version Control & Collaboration**: Git, GitHub workflows
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Automation**: Makefiles, Shell scripting
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins basics
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (EC2, S3, IAM basics)
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (kubectl, manifests, Helm basics)
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack basics
- **Security Practices**: SSH, secrets management, least-privilege IAM

## 📅 Roadmap

This apprenticeship follows a structured **30-day plan** (one topic per day, building on the previous).
👉 [See the detailed roadmap here](./roadmap.md) _(optional: you can create a separate file for your table roadmap we made earlier)._

## 📌 Ground Rules

To keep this apprenticeship professional and production-oriented, I’ll follow these principles:

1. **Automation First** – if a task can be automated, I’ll script it.
2. **Reproducibility** – every setup/config should be reproducible on another machine.
3. **Security by Default** – no secrets in code, SSH over HTTPS, least privilege IAM.
4. **Documentation Matters** – each day’s work will be documented in this repo.
5. **Fail Fast, Learn Fast** – mistakes will be logged and lessons captured.
